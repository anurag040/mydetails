I'm using module federation and webpack , I have one host app and 3 child apps with different URLs, when i refresh the routes in my host app it works, but when i refresh child apps thar are loaded in host, it gives 403 why? suggest a good fix in angular 16
403 Error When Refreshing Child Apps in Module Federation
This is a common issue with Module Federation where refreshing child apps (remote apps) results in a 403 error. The problem occurs because the browser is trying to directly access the child app's assets from their original URLs rather than through the host app's federation setup.

Root Cause
When you refresh a child app route:

The browser makes a direct request to the child app's server

The child app server doesn't recognize this as a federated request

The server either blocks it (403) or serves the full standalone app

Solutions for Angular 16
1. Configure Server-Side Routing (Recommended)
For development (using webpack-dev-server):

Add the following to your child app's webpack.config.js:

javascript
devServer: {
  historyApiFallback: true,
  headers: {
    "Access-Control-Allow-Origin": "*",
    "Access-Control-Allow-Methods": "GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH, OPTIONS",
    "Access-Control-Allow-Headers": "X-Requested-With, content-type, Authorization"
  }
}
For production (nginx example):

location /child-app/ {
  try_files $uri $uri/ /child-app/index.html;
}
2. Use Hash Location Strategy
In your child app's app.module.ts:

typescript
import { LocationStrategy, HashLocationStrategy } from '@angular/common';

@NgModule({
  providers: [
    { provide: LocationStrategy, useClass: HashLocationStrategy }
  ]
})
This makes URLs look like host-app.com/#/child-app/route but prevents 403 errors.

3. Properly Configure Public Path
In your child app's webpack config:

javascript
output: {
  publicPath: 'auto', // or your specific public path
  // ...
}
4. Ensure Correct Module Federation Configuration
In your child app's webpack config:

javascript
new ModuleFederationPlugin({
  name: 'childApp',
  filename: 'remoteEntry.js',
  exposes: {
    './Module': './src/app/child-app/child-app.module.ts'
  },
  shared: {
    // your shared dependencies
  }
})
5. Use a Proxy in Development
Add a proxy configuration to your host app's angular.json:

json
"serve": {
  "options": {
    "proxyConfig": "proxy.conf.json"
  }
}
And create proxy.conf.json:

json
{
  "/child-app": {
    "target": "http://localhost:PORT",
    "secure": false,
    "pathRewrite": {
      "^/child-app": ""
    }
  }
}
Best Practice Recommendation
The most robust solution is to:

Use proper server-side configuration (solution #1)

Ensure all assets are loaded with correct public paths

Use relative routes in your child apps

This maintains clean URLs while preventing 403 errors on refresh.

Would you like me to elaborate on any of these solutions for your specific setup?
