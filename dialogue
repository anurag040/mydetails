Anurag: Hey Jana, 
I’m still getting my bearings here. I mean, there are so many different systems like UPP, BS1, EMX, you name it. Is there some secret sauce to just, you know, feels like I need a PhD in dashboard-ology.

Jana: (chuckles) hey, oh, I feel you. that’s the fun! We like to keep you on your toes. Just when you think you know where everything is, there's another twist.

Anurag: (laughing) Well, I do like a good puzzle, but I was hoping for a little less mystery and a little more “here’s your easy button.”

Jana: Fair point! And actually, that’s the punchline. We’ve got this new thing called the Payments Digest app coming soon. It’s basically the easy button you’re looking for. One app to bring all those scattered bits of data into one place, and it does it with a bit of style, using Eliza.

Anurag: Now you’re talking! So instead of playing hide and seek with a dozen dashboards, I just open this app and everything’s right there?

Jana: Exactly! It’s like having a witty little co-pilot for your data journey. So no more dashboard detective work. All insights, real-time updates, and incidents, in one slick interface.
