Hi Team,

Here is a clear summary of how our child applications behave in the new architecture:

1. Can the child apps work independently?

Direct access: No. If a user opens a child app directly, it won’t work because there is no JWT token available for API calls, so the backend returns 401 Unauthorized.

Through the host: Yes. When opened via the host, the host supplies the valid token and everything works as expected.

2. Local testing

Child apps can be tested locally without the host by using a mock token or by running the backend in a local relaxed-security mode. This ensures API calls succeed without affecting production configs.

3. Dependency on the host

The only dependency is the JWT token.

Child apps do not depend on the host’s backend, session, Spring Security config, or deployment environment.

4. Session & Security considerations

No session issues — we are fully stateless.

Any Spring Security errors locally are typically due to missing or invalid tokens, not due to the architecture itself.

Summary

Standalone in production: No

Standalone for local development: Yes

Key requirement: Valid token

Host dependency: Only for authentication, nothing else

Let me know if you need a visual flow or if we should schedule a walkthrough.
