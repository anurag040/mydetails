First term: 2, 5, 20, 35, 67, 90, 112, 135, 145, 260, 267; with skip pointers at 2, 67, 145

Detailed Steps with Skip Pointers
Compare 2 and 3:

Current elements: 2 (first list) and 3 (second list).
Since 2 < 3, check the skip pointer in the first list (which points to 67).
Because 67 > 3, we should not use the skip pointer. Instead, we move the pointer in the first list to the next element.
Compare 5 and 3:

Current elements: 5 (first list) and 3 (second list).
Since 3 < 5, check the skip pointer in the second list (which points to 35).
Because 35 > 5, we should not use the skip pointer. Instead, we move the pointer in the second list to the next element.
Compare 5 and 5:

Current elements: 5 (both lists).
Since they match, we add 5 to the intersection and move both pointers to the next elements (20 in the first list and 7 in the second list).
Compare 20 and 7:

Current elements: 20 (first list) and 7 (second list).
Since 7 < 20, check the skip pointer in the second list (which points to 35).
Because 35 > 20, we should not use the skip pointer. Instead, we move the pointer in the second list to the next element.
Compare 20 and 20:

Current elements: 20 (both lists).
Since they match, we add 20 to the intersection and move both pointers to the next elements (35 in the first list and 35 in the second list).
Compare 35 and 35:

Current elements: 35 (both lists).
Since they match, we add 35 to the intersection and move both pointers to the next elements (67 in the first list and 150 in the second list).
Compare 67 and 150:

Current elements: 67 (first list) and 150 (second list).
Since 67 < 150, check the skip pointer in the first list (which points to 145).
Because 145 < 150, we use the skip pointer to jump to 145.
Compare 145 and 150:

Current elements: 145 (first list) and 150 (second list).
Since 145 < 150, move the pointer in the first list to the next element (260).
Compare 260 and 150:

Current elements: 260 (first list) and 150 (second list).
Since 150 < 260, check the skip pointer in the second list (which points to 270).
Because 270 > 260, we should not use the skip pointer. Instead, we move the pointer in the second list to the next element (260).
Compare 260 and 260:

Current elements: 260 (both lists).
Since they match, we add 260 to the intersection and move both pointers to the next elements (267 in the first list and 261 in the second list).
Compare 267 and 261:

Current elements: 267 (first list) and 261 (second list).
Since 261 < 267, check the skip pointer in the second list (which points to 270).
Because 270 > 267, we should not use the skip pointer. Instead, we move the pointer in the second list to the next element (270).
Compare 267 and 270:

Current elements: 267 (first list) and 270 (second list).
Since 267 < 270, move the pointer in the first list (end of the first list reached).
