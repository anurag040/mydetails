BEGIN DOCUMENT GENERATION ►

🧠 Role Assignment
You are an expert technical writer specializing in full-stack enterprise web development using Java 17 (Spring Boot) and Angular 16. Your output must strictly follow Google’s Technical Writing Guidelines, focus on clarity, accessibility, and structure, and use GitHub-Flavored Markdown with Mermaid.js diagrams, UI visuals, and code annotations.

🎯 Objective
Generate high-quality, well-organized, and visually appealing documentation that:

*   Guides developers through the codebase, architecture, and setup
*   Helps application users understand features, workflows, and UI navigation
*   Showcases how GitHub Copilot accelerated documentation creation
*   Is suitable for GitHub viewing and PDF export

👥 Target Audience
*   Intermediate to advanced developers familiar with Java, Spring Boot, Angular, and REST APIs
*   End users of the application, including internal business stakeholders, testers, or external clients who interact with the UI

Prioritize clarity over brevity for both groups

📚 Documentation Structure

✅ 1. Project Overview
    *   Purpose and business value of the project
    *   Key modules and functionality from both dev and user perspective
    *   Technologies used

🏗️ 2. System Architecture Diagrams (Mermaid.js)
    Generate diagrams for:
    *   Frontend-backend communication
    *   Authentication and session flow
    *   Component and data flow
    *   User interaction lifecycle

⚙️ 3. Setup & Installation
    For developers:
    *   Tools and environments needed
    *   How to run backend (Spring Boot) and frontend (Angular)
    *   Environment config and troubleshooting

💻 4. Code Walkthrough with Copilot Highlights
    *   Backend: controllers, services, models, repositories
    *   Frontend: modules, components, routing
    *   Include 💡 Copilot-accelerated code sections
    *   Add code comments, test cases, and error-handling examples
    *   Ensure cross-platform compatibility (Windows, Linux, macOS)

👩‍💻 5. User Guide (for Application Users)
    *   How to login/register
    *   Key workflows: dashboard usage, report generation, etc.
    *   UI walkthroughs with embedded screenshots
    *   Accessibility features (e.g., keyboard navigation, screen reader support)
    *   Link to user FAQ or support

🧪 6. Testing & Validation
    How developers can run tests:
    *   Backend: JUnit
    *   Frontend: Jasmine/Karma
    *   Sample test cases and output
    *   Exception handling examples
    *   Error messages and user-facing fallback screens

🔒 7. Best Practices
    *   Coding standards
    *   Security and performance tips
    *   User privacy handling (e.g., data storage, JWT expiration)
    *   Scalability and future-proofing

📷 8. Screenshots & UI Walkthrough
    Add images like:
    ```markdown
    ## 🖼️ Login Page

    ![Login UI](docs/login-ui.png)

    ## 📊 Dashboard View

    ![Dashboard](docs/dashboard-overview.png)
    ```
    *   ✔️ Use clear alt-text and ADA-compliant image contrast

📊 9. Manual vs Copilot Comparison Table
    ```markdown
    | Feature         | Manual Effort | Copilot Effort | Time Saved | Quality   |
    |-----------------|---------------|----------------|------------|-----------|
    | Setup Guide     | 1h            | 10m            | ✅✅✅       | ✅        |

    ```

🔁 10. Prompt Iteration Notes
    Track how prompt evolved from basic to polished
    Document what Copilot added in each round
    ```markdown
    - Iteration 1: Setup and code overview only
    - Iteration 2: Added diagrams, testing, UI walkthroughs
    - Iteration 3: Focused on user guidance and ADA compliance
    ```

📜 11. Licensing & Contribution
    *   Add license badge (e.g., MIT)
    *   Link to CONTRIBUTING.md and optionally CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md
    *   Mention internal or open-source contribution guidelines
