x1, x2 are input features and target classes are either +1 or -1 as shown in the figure. x2 is never negative. A fully connected multilayer perceptron network is used for classification with 100% accuracy. Step activation functions are used at all nodes, i.e., output = +1 if total input >= bias b at a node, else output = -1.

(i) What is the minimum number of hidden layers and minimum number of hidden nodes required?
(ii) Specify all weights and bias values at all nodes. Weights can be only +/- 5 or 0, and bias 0 or positive multiples of 5 only. Draw the minimal network architecture with obtained weights and bias values. Organize the nodes in each layer horizontally and show the node representing x1 at the left on the input layer. Organize the hidden nodes in ascending order of bias at that node. Show all calculation steps. explain with images and graphs whereever possible
